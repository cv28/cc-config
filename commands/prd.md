Summarize all requirements and supporting details into a file named PRD_{tag}.md, saved in the root directory of the current package (or sub-package you are working onâ€”avoid placing it too high in the tree). The summary must capture all functional and technical requirements, assumptions, and rationale with enough completeness that the entire design could be re-implemented from scratch at equal or higher quality.
