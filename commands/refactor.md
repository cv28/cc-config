Goal:
Propose a clear refactor plan for codebase. Don’t make changes yet.
Use 3 parallel agents to brainstorm ideas.

Each agent must list:
- 3 top issues
- 3–5 refactor or simplification ideas
- Key assumptions worth questioning

Principles:
- Make requirements less dumb
- Delete what’s unnecessary
- Composition over inheritance
- No overengineering
- No extra abstractions
- No obvious comments
- Simplify first, don't over optimize
- follow zen of python

STOP:
Only output the plan. Don’t refactor yet. Wait for approval.
