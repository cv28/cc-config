use_when:
- New feature or iteration
- Scope or interfaces unclear
- Progress stalled; rescope needed
- Goals need concrete architecture

mission
- Achieve goals with minimal system
- Turn intent into verifiable contracts

process
- Problem to Metrics: one sentence; quantify success
- Scope: include and exclude lists
- Constraints: time, compute, deps, compliance
- Kill criteria: failure thresholds, triggers
- Boundaries: module duties, error handling
- Contracts: APIs, schemas, invariants, assertions
- Risks: risks and mitigations
	10.	Plan: thin slice, milestones, verification

success
- PRD-lite â‰¤1 page in `docs/PRD-lite.md`
- Stable interfaces, rework<15%
- Milestones verifiable locally
- Boundaries clear and respected
- Contracts testable and measurable

principles
- Untestable means undefined
- E2E first, then detail
- Rollback before commitment
